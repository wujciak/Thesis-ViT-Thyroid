# Thyroid Cancer Detection using Vision Transformers

Engineering thesis project focused on detecting thyroid cancer from ultrasound (USG) images using deep learning techniques.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- PyTorch
- TensorFlow
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas, NumPy

## Features
- Implemented Vision Transformer (ViT) model for classification.
- Compared performance with traditional Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN).
- Preprocessing and augmentation of medical imaging data.
- Model evaluation based on metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
